            You do not need any of these documents to have an EPC carried out, and no single document
            is required. They are simply the things that sometimes help, where they exist and where
            the assessor can accept them as evidence under the assessment methodology.

        <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed text-secondary-700">
          An assessor cannot simply accept that concealed insulation exists. Where it cannot be
          safely accessed, measured and photographed, documentary evidence is needed — and it has to
          carry enough detail to establish what was actually installed, including the insulation
          thickness where the methodology requires it. Without that, the approved methodology
          requires a default or age-based assumption instead, which can be less favourable than what
          is genuinely there. The assessor is also responsible for validating the information used,
          which is why a verbal assurance on the day is not enough on its own.

          It is worth being precise about what that means:{' '}
          <strong className="font-semibold text-secondary-900">
            evidence changes what can legitimately be recorded, not what the rating will be
          </strong>
          . Bringing paperwork does not guarantee a better result — it just means a genuine
          improvement is less likely to go uncredited.{' '}
