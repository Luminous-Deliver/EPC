          materially larger or more complex than described — a significant undisclosed extension, a

          Your EPC rating is not chosen by the assessor
        </h3>
        <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed text-secondary-700">
          This is the question we are asked most, so it is worth being direct. Our role is to survey
          the property, record its physical characteristics and systems, verify what evidence we can
          accept, and enter that data. The rating is then calculated from that data by the
          government-approved methodology and software.

          No assessor can raise or lower a score to reach a requested result. If we could, the

          Why your EPC may differ from a neighbour&rsquo;s or an older certificate
        </h3>
        <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed text-secondary-700">
          EPC ratings are specific to the individual property. Two neighbouring homes can receive
          different ratings even when they look almost identical from the street. Things that
          legitimately change the result include:

        <ul className="mt-3 grid gap-x-8 gap-y-1.5 sm:grid-cols-2">
          {[
            'Position in the terrace — a mid-terrace home has fewer exposed walls than an end-terrace or semi',
            'Floor area, extensions and layout',
            'Wall, roof and floor construction and insulation',
            'Loft insulation depth, and whether it can actually be inspected',
            'Window and glazing age and specification',
            'Boiler, heating controls and hot-water cylinder',
            'Heat pumps, solar PV or other renewable systems',

            'The evidence available on the day',

              <span>{t}</span>

          The methodology changed in June 2025: RdSAP 10
        </h4>
        <p className="mt-2 leading-relaxed text-secondary-700">
          Existing homes have been assessed under the updated RdSAP 10 methodology since{' '}
          {govUk.rdsap10EffectiveFrom}, replacing the approach used for older EPCs. RdSAP is a
          reduced-data version of the full SAP calculation, used for existing homes because the
          complete construction data a new-build assessment relies on is rarely available for a
          property already standing.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-secondary-700">
          Older and newer EPCs may differ because the methodology, the data requirements, the
          property evidence and the technologies considered have all evolved. That is a change in
          how a home is assessed and recorded — not a judgement that older homes or older building
          standards are now &ldquo;bad&rdquo;, and not a requirement to modernise anything.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-secondary-700">
          Because of this, a new EPC should not be expected to reproduce an older certificate
          exactly, even if the property itself has not changed very much. An older EPC reflects the
          methodology and information available at the time; a current EPC assesses the property
          using today&rsquo;s approved methodology.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed text-secondary-700">
          This does not mean an older EPC was automatically wrong, or that RdSAP 10 will always
          produce a higher or lower rating. The result depends on the individual property, the
          features present, the evidence available and the methodology used. RdSAP 10 remains the
          approved methodology for existing dwellings in England and Wales under the{' '}

          Previous EPCs can also contain different assumptions or recorded information. If an older
          certificate looks inconsistent with the property, it is worth comparing the underlying
          property details rather than the letter rating alone — and genuine errors are possible,
          though they should not be presumed.
